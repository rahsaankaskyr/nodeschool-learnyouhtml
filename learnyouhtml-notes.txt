 ### What is HTML?  
   
  HTML or HyperText Markup Language is a markup language for creating  
  webpages. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser. They can include  
  writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML is used to mark  
  and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can show  
  them correctly.  
   
  HTML can also be used to add meta information to a webpage. Meta  
  information is information about the web page. For example, the name of  
  the person who made it. Meta information is not usually shown by web  
  browsers.  
   
  HTML was made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are many  
  versions of HTML. The current standard is HTML5. So, it is the version the  
  W3C recommends.  
   
 ### Why do I need to learn HTML?  
   
  HTML is a cornerstone of web. It's what you see in your browser every time  
  you open a favorite site.  
   
  If you're going to work in web development area, then you definitely need  
  to know what is HTML, how to read it and how to use it.  
   
 ### Browser  
   
  You need to have a browser — a program to read HTML documents and display  
  them. There are a lot of them, but we recommend one of these:  
   
   » [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)                              
   » [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new)                
   
 ### Editor  
   
  HTML-document could be created in any text editor, even Notepad.  
  Nevertheless, it would be better if you will use a special editor with  
  useful features, like syntax highlighting, tabs, autocompletions, etc.  
   
  We recommend you one of these text editors:  
   
   » [Atom](https://atom.io)                                                     
   » [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)                                
   » [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)                                             
   
 ### How to use this workshopper?  
   
  This workshopper will guide you through the simple exercises which explain  
  the core principles of HTML. In most cases, it's enough to use only three  
  commands:  
   
   » learnyouhtml run file.html will serve a local server at                                                                            
     http://localhost:3000/ with a preview of file.html.                         
   » learnyouhtml verify file.html will verify your file.                        
   » learnyouhtml help shows a help message.                                     
   
 ## THE CHALLENGE  
   
  Create a new empty file called index.html and put these lines in there:  
   
     <!DOCTYPE html>  
     <html>  
       <head>  
         <meta charset="utf-8">  
         <title>Hello, world!</title>  
       </head>  
       <body>  
         here is a body  
       </body>  
     </html>  
   
  This is your boilerplate for all of next exercises. Everything you're  
  going to do you'll do with that snippet.  
   
  It's okay if you don't understand what is going on. This lines will be  
  explained in following exercises.  
   
  Run learnyouhtml verify to verify your solution or learnyouhtml run to see  
  the result in the browser.  
   
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
   
   » To print these instructions again, run: learnyouhtml print                  
   » To execute your program, run: learnyouhtml run file.html                    
   » To verify your program, run: learnyouhtml verify file.html                  
   » For help run: learnyouhtml help 



## TAGS (Exercise 2 of 11)  
   
  HTML uses special bits of programming language called tags to let the  
  browser know how a webpage should look. The tags usually come in pairs: an  
  opening tag to tell the browser when to start doing something, and an  
  ending tag to tell the browser when to stop doing something. There are  
  many different kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose.  
   
  Let's think of tags like it's some kind of selection tool in text editors.  
  In text editor, such as Microsoft Office Word or Writer, if you want to  
  make text bold you select a part of text and click corresponding button  
  (b). In HTML, you have tags for that reason.  
   
                     ┌── a "selected" text ──┐  
                     ↓                       ↓  
     Lorem ipsum <tagname>dolor sit amet</tagname>, consectetur adipisicing elit.  
   
  Opening tags have a keyword, such as p, surrounded by angle brackets (<  
  and >). For example, the tag <p> tells the browser the start a new  
  paragraph. Ending tags look almost exactly the same, only they have a  
  forward slash (/) added just before the keyword. For example, the tag </p>  
  tells the browser to end a paragraph.  
   
     <p>this is a paragraph</p>  
   
  A small number of tags, like <br>, <img> and <hr>, can be used without an  
  ending tag. Here is what these tags do:  
   
   » <br> - produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful                                                                            
     for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is                                                                            
     significant.                                                                
   » <img> — represents an image in the document. We will consider this tag                                                                            
     later.                                                                      
   » <hr> — represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements. In                                                                            
     previous versions of HTML, it represented a horizontal rule. It may                                                                            
     still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers.                 
   
  You could use them like this:  
   
     <p>first paragraph</p>  
     <hr>  
     <p>second paragraph</p>  
   
 ### Basic HTML document  
   
  In previous exercise you've created a document. Let's consider its  
  content:  
   
     <!DOCTYPE html>  
     <html>  
       <head>  
         <meta charset="utf-8">  
         <title>Hello, world!</title>  
       </head>  
       <body>  
         here is a body  
       </body>  
     </html>  
   
  Here we have a <html> tag which wrap whole document — this tag indicates  
  where the HTML document begins and where it ends.  
   
  The HTML document has its own <head> and <body>. In the <head> tag we put  
  all information about document, like meta-tags and <title>. The content of  
  the <title> tag will be shown in the browser's title bar when displaying  
  this document. In the <body> we put everything we want to be drawn in  
  browser's window: headings, text, images, etc.  
   
  Probably, you still have a question: "What does the <meta charset="utf-8">  
  tag do?" Well, this is a special tag — a meta-tag. Meta-tags are used for  
  describing a document. It's a bit weird, but keep thinking about meta-tags  
  as an information about information. Directly, this tag means that we want  
  to use the utf-8 charset for our document.  
   
 ## THE CHALLENGE  
   
  You already have an HTML-document. In <body> add two paragraphs (<p>) with  
  any text you like. Please, separate these two tags with a horizontal rule  
  (<hr> tag).  






## ATTRIBUTES (Exercise 3 of 11)  
   
  In this exercise we are going to take a look at tag attributes.  
   
  Tag attributes extend the ability of tags and give us flexible control  
  over different options for displaying elements or configuring their  
  behavior. There are a lot of attributes for different purposes like color,  
  size, address and so on.  
   
  You can specify attributes like this:  
   
     <tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">some text</tag>  
     <!-- or for self-closing tag -->  
     <tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">  
   
  The HTML specification mandates that all values of attributes be wrapped  
  in double quotes (attribute="value") or single quotes (attribute='value').  
  Omitting these quotes wouldn't cause an error, because browsers, in most  
  of cases, will handle this code correctly. However, you can get a problem  
  if you try to define a value with spaces and don't wrap this value in  
  quotes. Consider this example:  
   
     <!-- with double quotes -->  
     <tag attribute="value with spaces"></tag>  
     <!-- with single quotes -->  
     <tag attribute='value with spaces'></tag>  
     <!-- without quotes -->  
     <tag attribute=value with spaces></tag>  
   
  In the third example above, we have got a problem. Only value would be  
  used as a value of attribute, so with and spaces would be ignored as  
  invalid attributes. That's why we suggest you to wrap values of attributes  
  in quotes.  
   
  There are a few important things you need to remember: if you didn't  
  specify an attribute, the browser will use default values for that  
  attribute. The order of the attributes doesn't matter. And each attribute  
  requires a specific type of value (text, number, path to file, etc).  
   
 ## THE CHALLENGE  
   
  You're already familiar with the <img> tag from the previous exercise.  
  This tag embeds an image in the page. This tag has a few important  
  attributes:  
   
   » src - the image URL. This attribute is mandatory for the <img> element.     
   » alt - this attribute defines the alternative text describing the image.                                                                            
     Users will see this text displayed if the image URL is wrong or if the                                                                            
     image is not yet downloaded.                                                
   » height - the intrinsic height of the image in pixels.                       
   » width - the intrinsic width of the image in pixels.                         
   
  You need to create an HTML document with an image. Feel free to set any  
  values for src and alt attributes.
